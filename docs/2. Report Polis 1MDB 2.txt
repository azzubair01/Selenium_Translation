On 11 March 2015, YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak gave a written reply in the Dewan Rakyat (Parliament) stating that investments amounting to approximately $1.103 billion were deposited in the form of cash US Dollars at BSI Bank Singapore. However, on 22 April 2015, a revelation by Sarawak Report stated that BSI Singapore Bank had reported to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) that no form of cash as stated by the YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak, was kept in an account at BSI Bank Singapore in fact, the account only contains paper assets whose actual total value is unknown. I would like to report and request the Police Diraja Malaysia to make a thorough investigation into the statement of the YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak which was found to have an element of fraud in the Dewan Rakyat (Parliament) in his written reply on 11 March 2015 if the Sarawak Report report has the basis of truth. I would also like to request the Police Diraja Malaysia to investigate the allegation of Bank BSI Singapore stating that 1Malaysia Development Berhad has given them false documents regarding the deposit. Based on the Sarawak Report disclosure, a thorough investigation by the Polis Diraja Malaysia must be conducted to:
1) Chairman of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad Advisory Board, YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak.
2) Chairman of the Board of Directors of 1Malaysia Development Berhad, Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin.
3) 1Malaysia Development Berhad President, Arul Kandasamy.

I would like to lodge a police report against YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak (Minister of Ministry of Finance 1), YAB Dato Seri Husni Handzilah (Minister of Ministry of Finance 2), Tan Sri Zetty Akhtar Aziz (Governor of Bank Negara), Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin (Chairman of 1Malaysia Development Berhad), Arul Kandasamy (President of 1Malaysia Development Berhad) and all the Board Members of 1Malaysia Development Berhad who have been responsible for cheating by saying that part of the money redeemed from the Cayman Islands was taken home and kept in cash of $1.103 billion (RM 3.6 billion) does not exist. BSI Bank in Singapore has denied the existence of cash in their accounts. YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak also deceived Parliament in his written reply in January 2015 on the same matter. I would also like the Police Diraja Malaysia (Police Diraja Malaysia) to investigate the act of concealing offenses in government matters that are wrong in terms of the provisions in the Malaysian Penal Code (Malaysian Criminal Law) Section 218. I have read this article at the Syed Bistro Restaurant located at Jalan Dang Wangi.

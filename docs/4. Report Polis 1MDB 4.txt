On July 2, 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that a total of $700 million had been entered into the personal account of YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak. On 14 July 2015, YB Datuk Husni Hanadzilah claimed that the allegations were baseless and incorrect. On 30 July 2015, YB Datuk Ahmad Maslan stated that no money went into the account of YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak. On 5 July 2015, YAB Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi stated that YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak should sue the Wall Street Journal WSJ because it is about the dignity of the country's leadership. On 1 August 2015, Rahmad Dahlan stated about which donation to which party? And he stated the party president has a trust account on behalf of the party. On 1 August 2015, YB Datuk Azalina Othman stated that any politician is free to receive funds from outside. On 3 August 2015, the MACC confirmed the RM 2.6 billion donor contribution fund instead of being channeled by an investment company set up by the Ministry of Finance, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1Malaysia Development Berhad). I would like to report and request the Polis Diraja Malaysia to make a thorough investigation into the statement of the YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak which was found to have an element of fraud in the Dewan Rakyat (Parliament) in his written reply on 11 March 2015 if the Sarawak Report report has the basis of truth. I would also like to request the Polis Diraja Malaysia to investigate the allegation of Bank BSI Singapore stating that 1Malaysia Development Berhad has given them false documents regarding the savings. Based on the Sarawak Report disclosure, a thorough investigation by the Polis Diraja Malaysia must be conducted to :
1) Chairman of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad Advisory Board, YAB Dato Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak
2) Chairman of the Board of Directors of 1Malaysia Development Berhad, Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin.
3) 1Malaysia Development Berhad President, Arul Kandasamy.

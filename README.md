# Google Translation using Selenium
- Recently I have been working on automated text files translation which will reduce the manual google translation process. Although there are numerous libraries out there that can perform similar task as this, I would like to share my work with the GitHub community. In this repository, I have prepared the required dependencies for the automated Google Translation process using Selenium library.

## Steps of Google Translation using Selenium
  1. Put the text files to be translated into the docs folder
  2. Check the GoogleTranslate.py and change the source and destination languages to be performed.
  3. Run GoogleTranslate.py.
  4. Your output will be available in the output folder.
  
## Platform used
- Jupyter Notebook for testing
- PyCharm for script development
- Python script for deployment
